## Baseline Implementations

In our paper, we benchmarked SAPP against a comprehensive set of baseline methods, including classic, state-of-the-art, and Transformer-based models. As per the Journal's request, we provide access to the baseline code as follows:

### Reproduced Baselines

For the following two Transformer-based models, we have included our own implementation within this repository to ensure a fair and consistent comparison. You can find their code in the `finol/model_layer` directory.

### Referenced Baselines

For most of the classic and state-of-the-art online portfolio selection strategies, we refer to existing implementations in well-established open-source libraries.

A majority of the following algorithms from our study can be found in the excellent `olps` Matlab library:
